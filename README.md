A simple 2D platforming engine, with a simple level to serve as a tech demo.
This was mostly a quick-and-dirty sandbox for testing and tweaking ideas of how
to implement physics, collision detection/resolution, etc. in a way that makes
the game feel fast and responsive. Thus, the code is very bad and ugly, please
don't judge me ;_;.

The game can be played by cloning the repository and running `python2 plat.py`.

The controls are:

- `WASD` to move
- `direction + J` to use a midair dash
- `direction + K` to "blink" (teleport)
- `direction + L` to fire a projectile (which nullifies fire projectiles)
- `;` to toggle slow motion
